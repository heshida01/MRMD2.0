Installation
--------

.. code-block:: none

   pip install numpy Cython
   pip install pymrmr

Usage
--------

pymRMR provides the single entry point method :code:`pymrmr.mRMR()`.

Data should be provided already discretised, as defined in the original paper [1]. This version of the algorithm does NOT provide discretisation, differently from the original C code.

This method requires 3 input parameters:

* First parameter is a pandas DataFrame (http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) containing the input dataset, discretised as defined in the original paper (for ref. see http://home.penglab.com/proj/mRMR/). The rows of the dataset are the different samples. The first column is the classification (target) variable for each sample. The remaining columns are the different variables (features) which may be selected by the algorithm. (see "Sample Data Sets" at http://home.penglab.com/proj/mRMR/ to download sample dataset to test this algorithm). **IMPORTANT**: the column names (feature names) should be of type string;
* Second parameter is a string which defines the internal Feature Selection method to use (defined in the original paper): possible values are "MIQ" or "MID";
* Third parameter is an integer which defines the number of features that should be selected by the algorithm.

The return value is a list containing the names of the selected features.



The following is an example of execution:

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: import pandas as pd

   In [2]: import pymrmr

   In [3]: df = pd.read_csv('test_colon_s3.csv')

   In [4]: pymrmr.mRMR(df, 'MIQ', 10)
