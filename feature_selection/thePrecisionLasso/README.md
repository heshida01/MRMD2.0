# the Precision Lasso

Implementation of the Precision Lasso in this paper:

    ''Wang H, Lengerich BJ, Aragam B, Xing EP. Precision Lasso: Accounting for Correlations and Linear Dependencies in High-Dimensional Genomic Data. Bioinformatics. 2017''

## Introduction

the Precision Lasso is a Lasso variant that is showed to work better compared to other Lasso variants in terms of variable selection when there are correlated and linearly dependent variables existing.

## File Structure:

* models/ main method for the Precision Lasso
* utility/ other helper files
* runPL.py main entry point of using the Precision Lasso to work with your own data

## An Example Command:

```
python runPL.py -t csv -n data/toy
```
#### Data Support
* Precision Lasso currently supports CSV and binary PLINK files. 
* Extensions to other data format can be easily implemented through `FileReader` in `utility/dataLoadear`. Feel free to contact us for the support of other data format. 

## Installation
You will need to have numpy and scipy installed on your current system.
You can install precision lasso using pip by doing the following

```
   pip install git+https://github.com/HaohanWang/thePrecisionLasso
```

You can also clone the repository and do a manual install.
```
   git clone https://github.com/HaohanWang/thePrecisionLasso
   python setup.py install
```

## Software with GUI
Software with GUI will be avaliable through [GenAMap](http://genamap.org/)

## Python Users
Proficient python users can directly call the Precision Lasso with python code, see the example [here](https://github.com/HaohanWang/thePrecisionLasso/blob/master/BasicExample.ipynb)
